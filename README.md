### Predicting survival of passengers on the Titanic dataset**

In this project I investigated a dataset containing information about Titanic passengers.
I used NumPy and Pandas, which are two popular Python packages used for manipulating datasets.
The goal of this project was to get acquainted with said tools, learn about the different data structures (NumPy Arrays, Series and DataFrames) they offer,
and practice the key steps on the whole data analysis process.

- I used Decision tree & Random forest algorithms to predict the percentage of passengers who survived.
